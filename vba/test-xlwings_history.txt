'     addin               Run "xlwings addin install" to install the Excel add-in (will be copied to the user's XLSTART folder).    
'                         Instead of "install" you can also use "update", "remove" or "status". Note that this command may take a   
'                         while. You can install your custom add-in by providing the name or path via the --file/-f flag, e.g.      
'                         "xlwings add-in install -f custom.xlam or copy all Excel files in a directory to the XLSTART folder by    
'                         providing the path via the --dir flag." To install the add-in for every user globally, use the --glob/-g  
'                         flag and run this command from an Elevated Command Prompt.
'     quickstart          Run "xlwings quickstart myproject" to create a folder called "myproject" in the current directory with    
'                         an Excel file and a Python file, ready to be used. Use the "--standalone" flag to embed all VBA code in   
'                         the Excel file and make it work without the xlwings add-in. Use "--server" for creating a project for     
'                         xlwings Server. Use "--addin --ribbon" to create a template for a custom ribbon addin. Leave away the "   
'                         --ribbon" if you don't want a ribbon tab.
'     restapi             Use "xlwings restapi run" to run the xlwings REST API via Flask development server. Accepts "--host" and  
'                         "--port" as optional arguments.
'     license             xlwings PRO: Use "xlwings license update -k KEY" where "KEY" is your personal (trial) license key. This   
'                         will update ~/.xlwings/xlwings.conf with the LICENSE_KEY entry. If you have a paid license, you can run   
'                         "xlwings license deploy" to create a deploy key. This is not available for trial keys.
'     config              Run "xlwings config create" to create the user config file (~/.xlwings/xlwings.conf) which is where the   
'                         settings from the Ribbon add-in are stored. It will configure the Python interpreter that you are
'                         running this command with. To reset your configuration, run this with the "--force" flag which will       
'                         overwrite your current configuration.
'     code                Run "xlwings code embed" to embed all Python modules of the workbook's dir in your active Excel file.     
'                         Use the "--file/-f" flag to only import a single file by providing its path. Requires xlwings PRO.        
'     release             Run "xlwings release" to configure your active workbook to work with a one-click installer for easy       
'                         deployment. Requires xlwings PRO.
'     copy                Run "xlwings copy os" to copy the xlwings Office Scripts module. Run "xlwings copy gs" to copy the        
'                         xlwings Google Apps Script module. Run "xlwings copy vba" to copy the standalone xlwings VBA module. Run  
'                         "xlwings copy vba --addin" to copy the xlwings VBA module for custom add-ins.
'     auth                Microsoft Azure AD: "xlwings auth azuread", see
'                         https://docs.xlwings.org/en/stable/server_authentication.html
'     vba                 This functionality allows you to easily write VBA code in an external editor: run "xlwings vba edit" to   
'                         update the VBA modules of the active workbook from their local exports everytime you hit save. If you     
'                         run this the first time, the modules will be exported from Excel into your current working directory. To  
'                         overwrite the local version of the modules with those from Excel, run "xlwings vba export". To overwrite  
'                         the VBA modules in Excel with their local versions, run "xlwings vba import". The "--file/-f" flag        
'                         allows you to specify a file path instead of using the active Workbook. Requires "Trust access to the     
'                         VBA project object model" enabled. NOTE: Whenever you change something in the VBA editor (such as the     
'                         layout of a form or the properties of a module), you have to run "xlwings vba export".
'     py                  This functionality allows you to easily write Python code for Microsoft's Python in Excel cells (=PY)     
'                         via a local editor: run "xlwings py edit" to export the code of the selected cell into a local file.      
'                         Whenever you save the file, the code will be synced back to the cell.
